Generated via AI Pipe for the following brief:
You are given two attachments: execute.py and data.xlsx.

- Commit execute.py after fixing the non-trivial error in it.
- Ensure it runs on Python 3.11+ with Pandas 2.3.
- Convert data.xlsx to data.csv and commit it.
- Add a GitHub Actions push workflow at .github/workflows/ci.yml that:
  - Runs ruff and shows its results in the CI log
  - Runs: python execute.py > result.json
  - Publishes result.json via GitHub Pages
- Do not commit result.json; it must be generated in CI..

## Setup:
Open index.html in your browser.
